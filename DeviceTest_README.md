# Java OOP Practice

Practicing abstraction, interfaces, inheritance, and polymorphism in Java.

##  What This Project Includes
- `abstract class Device` with common behavior and a constructor
- Interfaces: `Cameraa` and `MusicPlayerrr`
- `SmartPhoone` class that:
  - Extends the abstract class
  - Implements both interfaces
  - Overrides and defines the abstract/interface methods
- Demonstrates runtime polymorphism with interface references
- Shows use of `super()` in constructor chaining

##  How to Run
Run the `DeviceTest.java` file as a Java application.  
Expected output includes calls to `powerOn()`, `showBrand()`, `takePhoto()`, and `playMusic()`.


##  Concepts Practiced
- Abstraction
- Interface implementation
- Constructor usage with `super`
- Polymorphism via interface references
